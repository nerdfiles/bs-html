recently i've discovered a bit of critique in webland. a veteran web developer jason knight really gives framework developers a go, notably their frameworks tailwindcss, bootstrap, even html5 itself. we could say "frameworkification" falls under a categorically homogeneous formation of ossication in perceptual semantic resolutions which collapse specificity at a rate proportional to phonologic diachromia extant to psychological time scales. simply: how we talk about web influences the structuration of webbed documents. html itself isn't so much a language in a vacuum. it isn't software. commonly it's described as "technology". why call it this as opposed to anything else? could the web philosophically be considered impossible, or an impossible object, at any rate? obviously we could review laruelle's indictment: there are no great texts. and, as it were, the web cannot be one of them; but can the invention of a great book exist logically prior to some such text failing to exist? this question concerns our present writing: it is the first question of non-typography (non-standard typography).

as with most things of this order, we hazard the performance of the critique:

## jason knight's html

apparently the industry wants whatever devdrills is bleating not html with any semantics (even for forms, let alone hypermedia factors):
